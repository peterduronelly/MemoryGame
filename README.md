# MemoryGame
A simple memory game in Java

This is a .java file for a simple well-known memory game. You have 10 pairs of tiles. You have to click one tile then  another one. If they match, the tiles stay turned up. If not, you need to memorize the numbers on the tiles and the tiles are turned down. You need to find all the matching pairs. The program measures the time and the number of click pairs it took you to complete the game. 

Once the game is over you need to close and reopen the program to start a new game. 

Run from Netbeans or save it as a .jar file to play. 

It's nothing of a major stuff just a simple task in a Java course.
